## Containers

To run one, execute `docker run -d image_1`

To show all, execute `docker container ls` or `docker ps`

To access its shell, execute `docker exec -it {CONTAINER_ID} bash`

To remove one, execute `docker container rm {CONTAINER_ID``

### Commonly used options for `docker run`

- `--name`
    - Assign a name to the container, making it easier to identify and manage.
- `-p, --publish`
    - Publish a containerâ€™s port(s) to the host. This is useful when you want to access the services running inside the container from outside the container.
- `-e, --env`
    - Set environment variables inside the container. You can use this option multiple times to set multiple variables.
- `-d, --detach`
    - Run the container in detached mode, running the container in the background and not showing logs in the console.
- `-v, --volume`
    - Bind mount a volume from the host to the container. This is helpful in persisting data generated by the container or sharing files between host and container.
- `-it`
    - Run an interactive session

### Runtime Config

- `--cpus=2`
