## Data Persistence 


### Docker Volume
A volume is a directory that can be shared among containers. 

To create one, execute `docker volume create test_volume`

To inspect one, execute `docker volume inspect test-volume`

To show all, execute `docker volume ls`

To use one, execute with a `-v` or `--volume` flag. `docker run -v test_volume:/data_1 image_1`

To share a volume between another container, execute `docker run -v test_volume:/data_2 image_2`

To remove a volume, execute `docker volume rm test-volume`


### Bind Mounts 
Bind mounts allow you to map any directory on the host machine to a directory within the container.

To create one, execute with a `--mount` flag. `docker run --mount type=bind,src=/host/path,dst=/container/path image_name`

### tmpfs Mounts
Docker tmpfs mounts allow you to create a temporary file storage directly in the containerâ€™s memory. Data stored in tmpfs mounts is fast and secure but will be lost once the container is terminated.

To create one, execute with a `--tmpfs` flag. `docker run --tmpfs {container_path} image_name
